Feature: SDP Subarray Device
	#300-000000-029 rev 04 SDP to TM ICD
	#
	#Section 2.4.1 Control, State and Configuration
	#
	#Note that this has been updated by ADR-3.


	@XTP-119 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario: Device is initialised in the correct state
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When the device is initialised
		Then the state should be OFF
		And obsState should be EMPTY
		And adminMode should be ONLINE
		And healthState should be OK
		And the log should not contain a transaction ID


	#Required commands are present and they have the correct argument type and return type.
	@XTP-969 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario Outline: Command is present and has correct input and output types
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When the device is initialised
		Then the input type of <command> should be <input_type>
		And the output type of <command> should be <output_type>

		Examples:
		| command          | input_type | output_type |
		| On               | DevVoid    | DevVoid     |
		| Off              | DevVoid    | DevVoid     |
		| AssignResources  | DevString  | DevVoid     |
		| ReleaseResources | DevVoid    | DevVoid     |
		| Configure        | DevString  | DevVoid     |
		| End              | DevVoid    | DevVoid     |
		| Scan             | DevString  | DevVoid     |
		| EndScan          | DevVoid    | DevVoid     |
		| Abort            | DevVoid    | DevVoid     |
		| ObsReset         | DevVoid    | DevVoid     |
		| Restart          | DevVoid    | DevVoid     |


	#All commands, apart from On, are rejected when the state is OFF.
	@XTP-949 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario Outline: Command is rejected when the state is OFF
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When the state is OFF
		Then calling <command> should raise tango.DevFailed

		Examples:
		| command          |
		| Off              |
		| AssignResources  |
		| ReleaseResources |
		| Configure        |
		| End              |
		| Scan             |
		| EndScan          |
		| Abort            |
		| ObsReset         |
		| Restart          |


	#On command succeeds when the state is OFF.
	@XTP-917 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario: On command succeeds
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When the state is OFF
		And I call On
		Then the state should be ON
		And obsState should be EMPTY
		And the log should contain a transaction ID


	#Off command succeeds in any obsState.
	@XTP-918 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario Outline: Off command succeeds
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When obsState is <initial_obs_state>
		And I call Off
		Then the state should be OFF
		And obsState should be EMPTY
		And the log should contain a transaction ID

		Examples:
		| initial_obs_state |
		| EMPTY             |
		| RESOURCING        |
		| IDLE              |
		| CONFIGURING       |
		| READY             |
		| SCANNING          |
		| ABORTING          |
		| ABORTED           |
		| FAULT             |
		| RESETTING         |
		| RESTARTING        |


	#Commands succeed in obsStates where they are allowed and transition to the correct final obsState.
	@XTP-971 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario Outline: Command succeeds in allowed obsState
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When obsState is <initial_obs_state>
		And I call <command>
		Then obsState should be <final_obs_state>
		And the log should contain a transaction ID

		Examples:
		| command          | initial_obs_state | final_obs_state |
		| AssignResources  | EMPTY             | IDLE            |
		| ReleaseResources | IDLE              | EMPTY           |

		| Abort            | RESETTING         | ABORTED         |
		| ObsReset         | ABORTED           | IDLE            |
		| ObsReset         | FAULT             | IDLE            |
		| Restart          | ABORTED           | EMPTY           |
		| Restart          | FAULT             | EMPTY           |


	#Commands are rejected when called in obsStates where they are not allowed.
	@XTP-972 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario Outline: Command is rejected in disallowed obsState
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device

	#Commands that take a JSON configuration string are rejected when it is invalid.
	@XTP-965 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario Outline: Command is rejected with an invalid JSON configuration
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When obsState is <initial_obs_state>
		Then calling <command> with an invalid JSON configuration should raise tango.DevFailed

		Examples:
		| command         | initial_obs_state |
		| AssignResources | EMPTY             |
		| Configure       | IDLE              |
		| Configure       | READY             |
		| Scan            | READY             |



	#Commands that take a JSON configuration string are accepted without an interface value
	Scenario Outline: Command is accepted without an interface value in JSON configuration
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When obsState is <initial_obs_state>
		And I call <command> without an interface value in the JSON configuration
		Then obsState should be <final_obs_state>

		Examples:
		| command         | initial_obs_state | final_obs_state |
		| AssignResources | EMPTY             | IDLE            |
		| Configure       | IDLE              | READY           |
		| Configure       | READY             | READY           |



	@XTP-120 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario: AssignResources command configures processing blocks and sets receive addresses
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When obsState is EMPTY
		And I call AssignResources
		Then the processing blocks should be in the config DB
		And receiveAddresses should have the expected value



	@XTP-122 @XTP-118 @Current
	Scenario: ReleaseResources command clears receive addresses
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When obsState is IDLE
		And I call ReleaseResources
		Then receiveAddresses should be an empty JSON object



	#Commands that accepts 0.2 version of JSON configuration string
	Scenario Outline: Command is accepted with previous JSON configuration
		Given I have an SDPSubarray device
		When obsState is <initial_obs_state>
		And I call <command> with previous JSON configuration
		Then obsState should be <final_obs_state>

		Examples:
		| command          | initial_obs_state | final_obs_state |
		| AssignResources  | EMPTY             | IDLE            |
		| Configure        | IDLE              | READY           |
